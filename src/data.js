      "Wow! Your script was quite refreshing to look at. I am very impressed in the extent of detail and cleanliness you've provided here. Your naming conventions for variables and functions are extremely clear and meaningful. You've commented where needed, particularly above your function signatures and blocks of variable initialization. It was nice to see that your script wasn't flooded with comments, as some do, but you let your code do most of the talking, as it was legible enough to do so. Going for a projects exceeds can definitely lengthen a scripts length, and it's good practice to try to keep shorter applications, such as this, between maybe two-hundred to three-hundred lines. You did just that!!! This was done with pure elegance, and you should be absolutely proud of this accomplishment.",
